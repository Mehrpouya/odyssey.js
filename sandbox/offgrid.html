# A week on Eigg
```
- center: [56.9000, -6.2867]
- zoom: 12
```
‘Is it really that interesting to see the routes we take everyday,’ Jamie asks? 

Jamie - along with Kenny, Eddie, Bob and Jenny - make up Eigg Electric’s five member maintenance team, responsible for looking after Eigg’s award winning renewable energy system, which combines wind, solar and hydro electric energy to provide electricity to the island. 

Once a week the team meet at Eigg Electric’s main control centre, a well kept equipment shed next to a field of solar panels. Over the following seven days they take it in turns to carry out routine daily checks here every morning and evening. Some of them team drive to the control centre, Bob cycles, and Jenny comes on foot so she can take her dog, Harry, out out for a walk. 

‘Each of us travel along the same road from our different houses to this same point, the Solar Station,’ Jamie says. ‘It is that interesting?’ 

But each day’s journey is different. 

The seasons change, from the dark wet spring to the long summer days. With each season the population of Eigg make different demands on their electricity system. And the system changes too, as pieces of equipment are fine tuned, repaired and replaced. In April 2014, for example, two of Eigg’s four wind turbines, the most visible part of the island’s energy infrastructure, were out of service, awaiting the delivery of replacement bearings which the Eigg Electric team will eventually fit. 

As they make their daily journey each of the team members reflects on life off the mains electricity grid, their relationships to each other and to the system they maintain.     
  
Most of the routine checks take place at the solar station. But, from time to time, the team also have to visit the wind turbines and the hydroelectric turbine shed. Every quarter they have to check the levels and voltage of each individual battery in the main array of batteries. Someone puts on overalls, protective gloves and goggles and uses a measuring pipette to check the battery-acid levels. Someone else dons goggles and tests the voltages of each battery with a potentiometer. Each reading is read aloud, another team member notes them down, and after it is finished someone makes a cup of coffee for everyone.
